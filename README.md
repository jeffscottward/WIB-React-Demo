#Getting Started

NOTE: We are presuming you have either a `Mac` or `Linux` as a development machine.
Windows may also work but might have issues.

------------------------

If you dont already have `Node.js`, download from [nodejs.org](nodejs.org)

If you don't laready have `Yarn`, open your `Terminal` app and enter `brew install yarn`

If you don't laready have `Git`, open your `Terminal` app and enter `brew install git`

------------------------


Now that you have the need system tools, also in your `Terminal` or `Powershell` enter the following commands

```
git clone git@github.com:jeffscottward/WIB-React-Demo.git

cd WIB-React-Demo

yarn

npm start
```

### Whats going on?

This will

1. clone the code from Github down to your computer,

2. then "change directroy" to your project folder,

3. install all the dependencies that are already mapped out in the project's configuration for you

4. and then start the project.

5. It should automatically open a web browser for you to see the project running.

### Now what?


You may now use a text editor such as [Atom.io](Atom.io) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) to open the project and edit the code live!
